This specific retrieval model was done by:
*Fitting radius of the planet (Rp) with uniform priors containing bounds of 1.104R_jup to 1.656R_jup.
*Fitting equilibrium Temp of the star (Tp) with uniform priors containing bounds of 600.0K to 1800.0K.
*Fitting log metallicity of the star (Lz) with uniform priors containing bounds of -1dex to 3dex.
*Fitting CO ratio of the planet (Co) with uniform priors containing bounds of 0.05 to 2.0.
*Fitting log cloud top Pressure (Lp) with uniform priors containing bounds of -3dex to 3dex.
*Fitting log scattering factor (Ls) with uniform priors containing bounds of 0dex to 1dex.
*Fitting error multiple (Em) with uniform priors containing bounds of 0.5 to 5.
The number of live points (number of samples drawn per layer) was 1000.
